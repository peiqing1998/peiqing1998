## Hi there 👋 I go by SpaceX Ye. 

Typical social media usernames include `peiqing` and `singleton`.

peiqing pronounced like "pay cheese".

By day, I code in Rust; by night, I trade US stocks.

I have a personal website, where my resume is also hosted.

I'm currently working on:

[iceberg-rust](https://github.com/apache/iceberg-rust): Rust implementation of [Apache Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/).

[groth16](https://github.com/arkworks-rs/groth16): Rust implementation of [arkworks-rs](https://arkworks.rs/).

[algebra](https://github.com/arkworks-rs/algebra): Rust implementation of [arkworks-rs](https://arkworks.rs/).

Ask me about Federated Learning, TEE, Low-Level Performance Optimization and ZKP.

If you enjoy playing Souls-like games like Bloodborn, that's fantastic!

Last but not least: I'm not a native English speaker and am currently practicing my English. If you're interested in having an English conversation with me, I would really appreciate it. Please contact me.
