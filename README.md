Hi there 👋 I go by SpaceX Ye. Typical social media usernames include peiqing.

I have a personal website, where my resume is also hosted.

I'm currently working on:

iceberg-rust: Rust implementation of Apache Iceberg.

groth16: Rust implementation of arkworks-rs.

algebra: Rust implementation of arkworks-rs.

Ask me about Low-Level Performance Optimization, ZKP, Data Freedom, and 3A game Bloodborne (I'm master)!

Last but not least: I'm not a native English speaker and am currently practicing my English. If you're interested in having an English conversation with me, I would really appreciate it. Please contact me.
